# todo-App-tester
Todo App built with React that lets you add, complete, and delete tasksâ€”all while persisting your todos in the browser using localStorage. This project demonstrates how to manage state with React hooks, utilize lifecycle effects to load and save data, and implement custom CSS styling (including custom checkboxes) for a sleek, responsive UI.
